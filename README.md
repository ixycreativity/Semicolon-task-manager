React.js Project developed in a group through Skillbrain & Binar Code 2 month internship. Although we started as more than 10, only 3 continued it untill the end of the internship. We lost time waiting for students to complete their tasks before we re-assigned them to the working students, so the project is not completly finished and has parts that are not visible in the main task viewer, too.

I will continue improving it as a individual version.

The project nreeds Login & Pass, I will present it to whom interested, live, at an interview. 

We used React.js, JS, Material UI, Formik & Yup, AG Grid, Redux and more.
